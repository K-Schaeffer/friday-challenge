yarn start
```

Or

```sh
# friday-challenge/
yarn start:backend
```

### ðŸŽ² Running

docker compose up -d
```

#### Prepare the database (migration and seed)

```sh

yarn prepare

yarn prepare:backend
```

#### Start API

```sh
# friday-challenge/packages/backend

```

Congrats! With that you already have the API running on port **4000** ready to receive requests.

### ðŸ’» Testing

#### Database

You can check if the database is properly populated by running:

```sh
# friday-challenge/packages/backend
yarn preview
```

Or

```sh
# friday-challenge/
yarn preview:database
```

This will open Prisma Studio on http://localhost:5555, in which you can see all models and data available in the database.

#### API

Go to [Apollo Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer) and run queries/mutations from the API.
